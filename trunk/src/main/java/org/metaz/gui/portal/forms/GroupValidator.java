 /**
 * Defines the interface for classes that will play the role of group-validators.
 * <br>
 * The simplest criteria of inter-validation in a group of fields is - 
 * fields of one group are not required (to be filled or selected) unless
 * one of them is. This criteria of validation is implemented by <code>com.codepassion.form.utils.SimpleGroup</code> class.<br>
 * Another common criteria is used when submitting a password - 
 * fields of one group must have the same value.
 * Class <code>com.codepassion.form.utils.PasswordGroup</code>
 * provides such an implementation for two password fields.
 * <br>
 *
 * One FormElement object can not be registered in more than one GroupValidator.

 /**
  * <pre>
  * This method takes as argument an Hashtable of : 
  *  key   - a string representing the field name.
  *  value - a string or an array of strings representing the value, or the values
  *  of the corresponding field.
  * <p>
  * This method must return an Hashtable of :
  *  key   - a string representing the name of the field that resulted with
  *  an error message (according to validation).
  *  value - a string representing the error message of the field.
  * or it must return <code>null</code>, in case the validation found no errors.
  * <p>
  * Five important notes :
  * 1 - With TextBox-es, PasswordBox-es and RadioButton-s, their value
  * will come as a simple string.
  * 2 - With subclasses of MultipleChoiceBox-es, their value(s) will come
  * as an array of strings.
  * 3 - When the client does not enter a value or does not make a selection
  * to a field, the value of that field will come as an empty string, or as
  * an array of only one string, whose value is empty.
  * 4 - The nameValuePairs Hashtable will include all fields of this group.
  * 5 - Only name-errormessage pairs of the fields with error messages must
  * be included in the returned Hashtable, and if there aren't any, <code>null</code>
  * must be returned.
  * </pre>
  *
  * @param   nameValuePairs   name-value pairs to be tested.
  * @return    a Hashtable of name-errormessage pairs.

 /**
  * This is a utility method that can be used to set or customize
  * an error message that may be used by all fields of this group.
  * <p>
  * For example, in a group of password fields you might want to set an
  * error message like "(passwords must be the same)" that will apply to
  * both fields.
  * Implementation classes may supply a default error message,
  * and then let this method to customize it.
  * See <code>com.codepassion.form.utils.PasswordGroup</code> source code.
  * <p>
  * In <code>forms.xml</code> you set this error message through the attribute
  * <code>errormessage</code> of the <code>field-groupValidator</code> tag.
  * <p>
  * If you are not interested in this method, you can just empty implement it
  * and then ignore the <code>errormessage</code> attribute of 
  * <code>field-groupValidator</code> tag.
  *
  * @param  groupErrorMessage    an error message for all fields of the group.
