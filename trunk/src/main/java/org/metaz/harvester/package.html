<p>The  Harvester class initiates a check of an offered xml file to check on xml schema conformity, extracts all
 Learnobjects, transform them to records of metadata and pass them to the repository facade. The Harvester class is
 responsible for parsing xml data files into a  collection of LearningObjects  and passing this collection to the
 repository interface</p>
<p>There is essentially one methods of interacting with the harvester:
<li>running the Meta/Z Scheduler to start a poller to check if new xml data is offered for import</li>
