<p>Represents a repository containing so called 'learnobjects'. The repository should be accessed by a Facade instance, which can be
obtained by calling the method <code>getRepositoryFacade()</code> from the class MetaZ.</p>
<p>There are essentially two methods of interacting with the repository:
<li>updating the repository (all prevalent data will be deleted prior to update)</li>
<li>searching the repository for specific 'learnobjects' by specifying metadata values</li>
